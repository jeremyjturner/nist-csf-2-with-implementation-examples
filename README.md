# NIST CSF 2.0 & Implementation Examples in Markdown

This repo contains the NIST CSF 2.0 with NIST CSF 2.0 implementation examples in markdown.

# Purpose

If you are using LLMs or other AI tools, markdown format is much more reliable than PDF. I've manually curated the framework and implementation examples to help obtain better outputs.
